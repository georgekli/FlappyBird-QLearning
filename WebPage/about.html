        <h1> The Game </h1>

        <h2>Flappy Bird is a game where the user controls a bird that is stationary in x-axis but is constantly
            free falling on y-axis. The player can press the space bar to flap the birds wings and lift it up,
            stopping the free fall. While the user tries to stop the bird from falling to the ground, a series
            of upward and downward pipes is constantly approaching the bird. The goal of the game is to avoid
            the pipes (pass between them) and the ground for as long as you can. Each time the bird flies through
            a set of pipes a point is acquired.</h2>
        <h1> Game Core </h1>
        <h2>As mentioned above the actual game used in this project is forked from the <a href="https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird">FlapPyBird</a> github repository,
            witch provides the implementation of the game in python. During each frame the agent needs to decide
            on whether to flap the bird's wings or not.
